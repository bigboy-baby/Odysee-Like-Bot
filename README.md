Odysee.com Like Bot

Basically odysee is a popular alternative to YouTube. 
I found an exploit to generate "accounts" instantly and infinitely a while ago (probably back around feburary or march)
Go look at my [Odysee Follow Bot](https://github.com/bigboy-baby/Odysee-Follow-Bot)

The exploit works by sending either a GET or POST request to the /user/new api endpoint. The endpoint gives an auth token that is supposed to be used to validate a new account signup put aparently they got retard monkey brains over at the odysee dev team who got fucked by a 14 year old and you can use these blank auth tokens for follows, likes, comments, refering, etc.
Fr this exploit op and ive used it for so long cant wait for it to get patched by the half brained dev team ðŸ¥³

This one is slightly different than the follow bot, you need to input a claim id. To get the claim id go to the network tab in dev tools, like a video, and look for the reaction/react api endpoint. Then go to payload and the claim id is right there.
